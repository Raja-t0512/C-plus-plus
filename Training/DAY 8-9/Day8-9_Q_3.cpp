// Pankaj and Mythili were both asked to write the code to evaluate the following expression:
// a - b+ c/(a-b) + (a-b)^2
// Pankaj writes the following code statements (Code A):
// print (a-b) + c/(a-b) + (a-b)*(a-b)
// Mythili writes the following code statements (Code B):
// d = (a-b)
// print d + c/d + d*d
// If the time taken to load a value in a variable, for addition, multiplication or division between two operands is same, which of the following is true?
// a) Code A uses lesser memory and is slower than Code B   
// b) Code A uses lesser memory and is faster than Code B
// c) Code A uses more memory and is faster than Code B
// d) Code A uses more memory and is slower than Code B


// ANSWER -> a) Code A uses lesser memory and is slower than Code B
