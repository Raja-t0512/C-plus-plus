//  A pseudo-code is used. Assume that when two data-types are processed through an operator, the answer
//  maintains the same data-type as the input data-types. Assume that all data-types have enough range to 
//  accommodate any number. If two different data-types are operated on, the result assumes the more 
//  expressive data-type.
//       What will be the output of the following pseudo-code statements?
//        Integer a = 456, b, c, d =10
//         b = a/d
//         c = a - b
//         print c
//         a) 410
//         b) 410.4
//         c) 411.4
//         d) 411  

// ANSWER -> d) 411
