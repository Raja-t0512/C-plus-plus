// An iterative algorithm to get the total number of leaf nodes of binary tree.
// ANSWER: -
// If the root is null then return zero.
// Start the count with zero.
// Push the root into Stack.
// Loop until Stack is not empty.
// Pop the last node and push left and right children of the last node if they are not null.
// Increase the count.
